Note: to print the column names set this property
set hive.cli.print.header=true;

TAKEAWAY POINTS FROM THIS EXERCISE:
* CAN NOT ALTER COLUMNS WITH BOOLEAN DATA TYPES TO OTHER DATA TYPES 
* DO NOT USE BOOLEAN DATA TYPE COLUMNS AS PARTITION DATA COLUMN
* WHEN THERE IS VALUES LIKE 1 AND 0, THEN GIVE THE DATA TYPE AS INT BUT NOT AS BOOLEAN, IF YOU DO SO THEN THE VALUES WILL BE POPULATED WITH 'NULL's

### TASK
Increase the number of buckets in the bucketed table to 10 and redistribute the data.

    * increase the number of buckets using ALTER command will NOT redistribute the data.
    * create new table, load the data from bucketted table and then drop the old table. 
        this approach will effectively re-distribute the entire data.
